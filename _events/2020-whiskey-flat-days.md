## 63rd Annual Whiskey Flat Days 
### President's Day Weekend * February 14-17, 2020
One of the most popular Festivals in all of Southern California.

> Just a short 3 hour drive from Los Angeles to the Lake Isabella recreation area,
you will find the quaint town of Kernville, home to Whiskey Flat Days
(50 miles east of Bakersfield on Hwy 178).  Whiskey Flat Days is held every
Presidents Day Weekend. It is a leap back to the good ol' wild west days when the
area was settled by gold miners, cattle ranchers and trappers. Join us when
Kernville reverts to its old name "Whiskey Flat" for four nostalgic days of fun
for the entire family. Parade, Wild West Daze Rodeo, Wild West Encampment,
Carnival Rides, Frog Jumping Contests, Whiskey Flat Mayor Contest, Food & Craft
Booths, Epitaph, Costume & Whiskerino Contests, Line Dancing, Pet Parade, Blue Grass
& Country Western Music, Art Show, Gunfighter Skits, Kids Activities, Games,
& much more!

Parade: Saturday February 15, 2020. 10:00am.
